    "content": "Hi, 27 (F) just got diagnosed 3 months ago after about a year of bleeding. Started seeing naturopathic doctor because I am scared of western medicine and can\u2019t wrap my mind around this not being caused by an imbalance or infection. \n\nStarted on VSL #3 probiotics for UC, butyrate, GI Complete, and Fibermend supplements. Had bleeding go away for about a month but it\u2019s back again and worse. She now wants me to take food sensitivity testing. I have cut out gluten and lactose to see if it will help, it hasn\u2019t.\n\nGoing in for another scope soon, but I know it\u2019s not going to look good. Does anybody have experience with trying the natural ways? Has anybody had success? \n\nAlso, how do you explain this to work people when it doesn\u2019t look or sound like you have issues?\n\n\nEdit: thank you all so much for the responses, and tough love in a sense. I think it\u2019s helped me come to terms in a way and I decided I will do both medicine routes because I realize now how serious this is. It\u2019s scary but I can\u2019t describe how thankful I am for all of your time in responding.",

    "content": "I was diagnosed in early December with a rare form of breast cancer, Inflammatory Breast Cancer. Stage 4 de novo. It\u2019s like regular breast cancer, but significantly more aggressive and a lot worse. I was diagnosed 9 days before my birthday and a week and a half after losing my job. It\u2019s just been shit luck after shit luck since then.\n\nI have a small group of people in my life who love me and support me however they can. My finances are in the toilet and I\u2019ll probably have to file for bankruptcy soon, even after having qualified for federal disability payments due to being diagnosed with a disorder that is guaranteed to end in death (their words, not mine). My life is just stressor after stressor after stressor.\n\nI\u2019ve completed over 20 rounds of IV chemo and look like a gremlin as a result. No hair, my fingernails and toenails are horrific, and of course none of that glamorous Hollywood cancer weight loss\u2014try weight gain. And a lot of it. It sucks. Now I\u2019m supposed to take pills and eventually have a mastectomy and maybe have my ovaries out too, and along the way probably once or twice need my lungs drained of fluid, hope upon hope that my many many tumors don\u2019t infiltrate my brain too, and eventually in about 4-5 years I\u2019ll kick the bucket.\n\nThe real off my chest bit here is that I wish it would just happen faster. Cancer is the most tedious, brutally painful, absolute slowest marathon and I am just done with it.\n\nI have an appointment with my oncologist next week and I\u2019m going to ask about hospice. How close to deaths door do I need to be to quality. When can I just say, enough is enough. I used to have things I looked forward to, things I wouldn\u2019t want to miss if I were dead, but I don\u2019t have any of that anymore. I just want it to be over. I\u2019m sick of the endless financial stress and the endless cancer aches and pains and the endless infusions and appointments and hospitalizations. I\u2019m just done with it all.\n\nAnd now I\u2019m going to tell you my greatest secret ever. I\u2019ve already stopped taking my cancer meds. I throw them out instead of taking them. Because I WANT my tumors to grow, I want the blood clots in my lungs to grow, I want it all to get worse so I can finally just enter hospice and be done with it. I\u2019m so tired.\n\nAnd I\u2019m only 34.",
